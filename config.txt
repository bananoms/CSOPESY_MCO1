max-overall-mem 
Maximum memory available in bytes.

mem-per-frame 
The size of memory in bytes per frame. This is also the memory size per page. The total number of frames is equal to max-overall-mem / mem-per-frame.

min-mem-per-proc 
Memory required for each process created via the “scheduler_start” command. 

Let P be the number of pages required by a process and M is the rolled value between min-mem-per-proc and max-mem-proc. 
P can be computed as M / mem-per-frame.
